## Using express.js as a Server

-   how to handle client requests
-   returning responses
-   how to handle errors
-   what happens when a user submits a web form

client-server model:

1. client makes a request, server replies.
2. Client knows nothing about what happens behind the scenes

## Roadmap

### challenge: create note-taking app

-   Express.js
    -   serve static HTML files
    -   create an API to handle GET and POST requests
-   parse parameters in server-side routes
-   submit form data to a server
-   implement separation of concerns for routing
-   retrieve note data from JSON
-   deploy using Heroku

### What I'll Know How To Do

-   configure an Express.js app to handle GET and POST requests
-   Configure an Express.js app to serve static files
-   Identify how client-side requests relate to server-side responses
-   Parse optional and required parameters when creating server-side routes
-   Implement client-side POST requests to submit form data to a server
-   Implement separation of concerns for routing
-   Deploy a server-side application to the Heroku platfor

## 11.1.1 Introduction

### Lesson Objectives

## 11.1.2 Preview

Which of the following gameplans do you think is the best way to tackle this lesson?

| Step | Task                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Set up the project in GitHub.          | We’ll create the project’s repository in GitHub and establish the feature branches using issues.                                                                     |
| 2    | Create an Express.js server.           | We’ll use a library called Express.js to create a Node-based web server.                                                                                             |
| 3    | Handle requests for animals.           | We’ll use Express.js to create an HTTP route that sends the requestor all of the animal data as JSON.                                                                |
| 4    | Deploy to Heroku.                      | We’ll get introduced to Heroku early on for this project so that we can continuously deploy the server as we go. And GitHub Pages doesn't support Node applications. |
| 5    | Handle requests for a specific animal. | We’ll create one more API route that allows us to search for one specific animal in the array.                                                                       |

## 11.1.3 Set Up the Project

Standard Steps

1. Create the Repo
1. Create the GitHub Issues
1. Set Up the Project Directory
1. Create the Project Files

### Create the Repo

### Create the GitHub Issues

### Set Up the Project Directory

### Create the Project Files

## 11.1.4 Create an Express.js Server

-   servers provide functionality to a client.
-   Node.js has built-in libraries that support server functionality, but they require [significantly more code](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html).

### Install Dependencies

-   `npm init -y` where the `-y` gives default "yes" answers
-   `npm i express` where the `i` is for `install`

### Set up server.js

`const express = require('express');`

To instantiate the server, you must instantiate the server and listen for requests

1. instantiate
   `const app = express();` - using `app` variable so we can later chain on methods to the Express.js server.
2. listen
   `app.listen(3001, () => { console.log(`API server now on port 3001!`); });`

3. `npm start` will start the server.

### Ports and Hosts

| Word | Definition                               |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Host | A website's address                      |
| Port | gives the exact destination for the host |

-   typically, websites use ports 80 (http) or 443 (https)
-   ports with 1024 and under are considered special by the OS, and ofter require special permissions.
-   Ports around 3000 is common practice and easy to remember
-   You could choose one from 1024 to 49,151

## 11.1.5 Handle Requests for Animals

???
Why is it `/api/animals` instead of `/data/animals`

## 11.1.6 Deploy to Heroku

GitHub pages only deploys static HTML.
Because we need to delpoy a `server.js` running Node.js processes, we use Heroku.

### Development process

-   local development environment: local environment on my machine
    -   code new features
    -   fix bugs
    -   make code updates
-   Production environment
    -   Cloud-hosted
    -   Must be in working order
    -   live version of the app (GitHub pages, Heroku, aws, Azure)
    -   hosts the updated and tested version of code
    -   accessible to users
    -   Has its own production database (usually in cloud) separate from development environment
-   Some companies have a Staging environment
    -   replica of production environment
    -   helps test changes in the local environment
    -   additional layer of QA

## 11.1.7

Getting one specific animal rather than an array of all the animals

```
app.get('/api/animals/:id', (req, res) => {
  const result = findById(req.params.id, animals);
    res.json(result);
});
```

-   `req` object gives us `req.params`. Must be defined in route path with `<route>/:<parameterName>`
-   praam route must come after the other GET routes.
-   using `findById` because 
   -  this should only return a single animal.
   -  won't be a query on a single animal, so don't need all the other code.
